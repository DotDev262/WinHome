## ⭐ Why WinHome?

I built WinHome to create a **lightweight, dependency-free configuration tool** that runs **natively on Windows** as a **single-file EXE** — no Python, Ruby, or agent installations required.

WinHome focuses on the real needs of **Windows developers**, including:

- First-class **Winget** support  
- Deep **WSL** provisioning  
- Native **Registry tweaks** and system settings  

The goal is to make Windows environment automation as simple, fast, and reliable as possible.

---

## 🚀 Installation

WinHome ships as a **self-contained single EXE** (no .NET runtime needed), compatible with all Windows x64 systems.

1. Visit the **Releases Page**
2. Download **WinHome.exe**
3. Run it from PowerShell or CMD

### Quick Install (PowerShell)

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/DotDev262/WinHome/releases/latest/download/WinHome.exe" -OutFile "WinHome.exe"
````

---

## 🔧 How It Works

WinHome reads a declarative `config.yaml` that defines your desired system state.
A built-in **Reconciliation Engine** compares it to the live system and ensures everything matches.

* Tracks system state in `winhome.state.json`
* Detects and corrects configuration drift
* Fully idempotent — run it once or 100 times: *the result is identical*

```
.\WinHome.exe [options]
```

### Options

* `--config <path>`
* `--dry-run`, `-d`
* `--profile <name>`
